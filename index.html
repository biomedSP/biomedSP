<h1>Biomedical Signal Processing</h1>
<img class="main-image" src="images/people/group_img_scaled.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>We are interested in developing and applying signal processing algorithms to biomedical data.</p>
<p>Our main aim is to reveal the subtle changes that major diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and epilepsy) cause in the brain activity and how this changes in different conditions and mental states.</p>
