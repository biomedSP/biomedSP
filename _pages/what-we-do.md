Welcome to our university research group! We're a team of dedicated researchers, including PhD candidates, a postdoctoral fellow, and our esteemed Principal Investigator. Our focus is on exploring the fascinating world of machine learning and signal processing, particularly in the context of biosignals like brain waves (EEG), advanced imaging (fMRI), and other intricate data obtained from hospital and intensive care settings.

Our primary goal is to unravel the complexities of various diseases such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, or dementia. Through meticulous analysis and cutting-edge methodologies, we aim to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of these conditions. Additionally, our team includes experts in graph theory, enabling us to delve into the interconnected networks within biological systems.
