title: "A WINDOW IN THE BRAIN: DETECTING SEIZURES USING 8-CHANNELS EEG MONTAGE AND PHASE SYNCHRONISATION"
excerpt: In this project, we aim to determine the seizure detection performance of PS calculations using only 8 channels of routinely collected EEG as the first step towards assessing the feasibility of using PS calculation to seizure detection in PCC settings.

Seizures may be detected by calculating Phase synchrony (PS) changes on multi-channels electroencephalograms (EEG). This quantitative method of seizure detection is currently not translated into clinical use in paediatric critical care (PCC) settings because it requires a minimum of 19 EEG channels, which is not deliverable without a round-the-clock neurophysiology service. In this project, we aim to determine the seizure detection performance of PS calculations using only 8 channels of routinely collected EEG as the first step towards assessing the feasibility of using PS calculation to seizure detection in PCC settings.
