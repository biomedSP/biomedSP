      We present a novel method, called Dispersion Entropy for Graph Signals, as a powerful tool for analysing the irregularity of signals defined on graphs. generalizes the classical dispersion entropy concept for univariate time series, enabling its application in diverse domains such as image processing, time series analysis, and network analysis. Furthermore, establishes a theoretical framework that provides insights into the irregularities observed in graph centrality measures and in the spectra of operators acting on graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of in detecting changes in the dynamics of signals defined on both synthetic and real-world graphs, by defining a mix process on random geometric graphs or those exhibiting small-world properties. Our results indicate that effectively captures the irregularity of graph signals across various network configurations, successfully differentiating between distinct levels of randomness and connectivity. Consequently, provides a comprehensive framework for entropy analysis of various data types, enabling new applications of dispersion entropy not previously feasible, and uncovering nonlinear relationships between graph signals and their graph topology.

      Recent technological advances enable the acquisition of diverse datasets that demand data-driven analysis. In this context, we seek to take advantage of diverse data modalities to explore the links between childhood development, structure and function of the brain. We deploy a data fusion model using coupled matrix-tensor decomposition of electroencephalography (EEG), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and phenotypic score data to investigate how functional, structural, and phenotypic variables reflect development in young children with epilepsy. Our model is based on Canonical Polyadic Decomposition and optimised with grid search to predict developmental scores of pre-school children. The model is promising and able to show relationships between modalities that agree with clinical expectations. The score prediction yields a high similarity at the group level and potential to predict laborious and time-consuming developmental scores from routinely collected sMRI and/or EEG data, thus becoming a stepping-stone towards more efficient clinical assessment of brain development in young children.

      A WINDOW IN THE BRAIN: DETECTING SEIZURES USING 8-CHANNELS EEG MONTAGE AND PHASE SYNCHRONISATION

      Seizures may be detected by calculating Phase synchrony (PS) changes on multi-channels electroencephalograms (EEG). This quantitative method of seizure detection is currently not translated into clinical use in paediatric critical care (PCC) settings because it requires a minimum of 19 EEG channels, which is not deliverable without a round-the-clock neurophysiology service. In this project, we aim to determine the seizure detection performance of PS calculations using only 8 channels of routinely collected EEG as the first step towards assessing the feasibility of using PS calculation to seizure detection in PCC settings. 
  - title: A noise-robust Multivariate Multiscale Permutation Entropy for two-phase flow characterisation

    description: >
      Using a graph-based approach, we propose a multiscale permutation entropy to explore the complexity of multivariate time series over multiple time scales. This multivariate multiscale permutation entropy (MPEG) incorporates the interaction between channels by constructing an underlying graph for each coarse-grained time series and then applying the recent permutation entropy for graph signals. Given the challenge posed by noise in real-world data analysis, we investigate the robustness to noise of MPEG using synthetic time series and demonstrating better performance than similar multivariate entropy metrics. Two-phase flow data is an important industrial process characterised by complex, dynamic behaviour. MPEG characterises the flow behaviour transition of two-phase flow by incorporating information from different scales. The experimental results show that MPEG is sensitive to the dynamic of flow patterns, allowing us to distinguish between different flow patterns.

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly with a progressive decline in cognitive function significantly affecting quality of life. Both the prevalence and emotional and financial burdens of AD on patients, their families, and society are predicted to grow significantly in the near future, due to a prolongation of the lifespan. Several lines of evidence suggest that modifications of risk-enhancing life styles and initiation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in the early stage of disease, although not able to modify its course, helps to maintain personal autonomy in daily activities and significantly reduces the total costs of disease management. Moreover, many clinical trials with potentially disease-modifying drugs are devoted to prodromal stages of AD. Thus, the identification of markers of conversion from prodromal form to clinically AD may be crucial for developing strategies of early interventions. The current available markers, including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis are expensive, poorly available in community health facilities, and relatively invasive. Taking into account its low cost, widespread availability and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) would represent a candidate for tracking the prodromal phases of cognitive decline in routine clinical settings eventually in combination with other markers. In this scenario, the present paper provides an overview of epidemiology, genetic risk factors, neuropsychological, fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in AD and describes the potential role of EEG in AD investigation, trying in particular to point out whether advanced analysis of EEG rhythms exploring brain function has sufficient specificity/sensitivity/accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD.

      Electrophysiology provides a real-time readout of neural functions and network capability in different brain states, on temporal (fractions of milliseconds) and spatial (micro, meso, and macro) scales unmet by other methodologies. However, current international guidelines do not endorse the use of electroencephalographic (EEG)/magnetoencephalographic (MEG) biomarkers in clinical trials performed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), despite a surge in recent validated evidence. This position paper of the ISTAART Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area endorses consolidated and translational electrophysiological techniques applied to both experimental animal models of AD and patients, to probe the effects of AD neuropathology (i.e., brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration) on neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning neural excitation/inhibition and neurotransmission as well as brain network dynamics, synchronization, and functional connectivity, reflecting thalamocortical and corticocortical residual capacity. Converging evidence shows relationships between abnormalities in EEG/MEG markers and cognitive deficits in groups of AD patients at different disease stages. The supporting evidence for the application of electrophysiology in AD clinical research as well as drug discovery pathways warrants an international initiative to include the use of EEG/MEG biomarkers in the main multicentric projects planned in AD patients, to produce conclusive findings challenging the present regulatory requirements and guidelines for AD studies.

      Nonlinear techniques have found an increasing interest in the dynamical analysis of various kinds of systems. Among these techniques, entropy-based metrics have emerged as practical alternatives to classical techniques due to their wide applicability in different scenarios, especially to short and noisy processes. Issued from information theory, entropy approaches are of great interest to evaluate the degree of irregularity and complexity of physical, physiological, social, and econometric systems. Based on Shannon entropy and conditional entropy (CE), various techniques have been proposed; among them, approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, distribution entropy, permutation entropy, and dispersion entropy are probably the most well known. After a presentation of the basic information-theoretic functionals, these measures are detailed, together with recent proposals inspired by nearest neighbors and parametric approaches. Moreover, the role of dimension, data length, and parameters in using these measures is described. Their computational efficiency is also commented. Finally, the limitations and advantages of the above-mentioned entropy measures for practical use are discussed.

      Entropy metrics (for example, permutation entropy) are nonlinear measures of irregularity in time series (one-dimensional data). Some of these entropy metrics can be generalised to data on periodic structures such as a grid or lattice pattern (two-dimensional data) using its symmetry, thus enabling their application to images. However, these metrics have not been developed for signals sampled on irregular domains, defined by a graph. Here, we define for the first time an entropy metric to analyse signals measured over irregular graphs by generalising permutation entropy, a well-established nonlinear metric based on the comparison of neighbouring values within patterns in a time series. Our algorithm is based on comparing signal values on neighbouring nodes, using the adjacency matrix. We show that this generalisation preserves the properties of classical permutation for time series and the recent permutation entropy for images, and it can be applied to any graph structure with synthetic and real signals. We expect the present work to enable the extension of other nonlinear dynamic approaches to graph signals.

      Multivariate entropy quantification algorithms are becoming a prominent tool for the extraction of information from multi-channel physiological time-series. However, in the analysis of physiological signals from heterogeneous organ systems, certain channels may overshadow the patterns of others, resulting in information loss. Here, we introduce the framework of Stratified Entropy to prioritize each channels' dynamics based on their allocation to respective strata, leading to a richer description of the multi-channel time-series. As an implementation of the framework, three algorithmic variations of the Stratified Multivariate Multiscale Dispersion Entropy are introduced. These variations and the original algorithm are applied to synthetic time-series, waveform physiological time-series, and derivative physiological data. Based on the synthetic time-series experiments, the variations successfully prioritize channels following their strata allocation while maintaining the low computation time of the original algorithm. In experiments on waveform physiological time-series and derivative physiological data, increased discrimination capacity was noted for multiple strata allocations in the variations when benchmarked to the original algorithm. This suggests improved physiological state monitoring by the variations. Furthermore, our variations can be modified to utilize a priori knowledge for the stratification of channels. Thus, our research provides a novel approach for the extraction of previously inaccessible information from multi-channel time series acquired from heterogeneous systems.
